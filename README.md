# MySQL-Frontend
A stripped-down GUI frontend developed in Python3 for simple admin tasks on MySQL-Server running on the localhost. Developed for my CS School Project.

# System Requirements:
This program should run on any computer with Python3, MySQL Server, and the below-mentioned Python Libraries installed.

# Installation Pre-requisites
1. The Following Python Libraries are required to execute the program:
    1. pyqt5
    2. pyqt5-tools
    3. mysql-connector


You may use the PIP package manager to install the above modules on your system Python3 environment or
using the adjacent library package manager bundled in with your IDE.

2. MySQL/MariaDB-Server from v5.1 and above, active and running.

# Installation and Running

1. Download the entire repo contents as a .zip and extract it in a folder on your computer.
2. Execute the latest version of the python file <b>MySQL-Frontend_v2.0xx.py<\b> on your Python shell with above libraries installed on the computer.
3. You are done.

Please do not move around any .png or .ui file into other directories otherwise the python script may not run well. 

# Known Look-&-Feel issues
This program was developed to run on my GNU/Linux system, utilizing the Qt5Ct tool to configure the program's UI Elements' theming, default font size, behavior etc.
Hence it may not look good on Windows for example, which does not support configuring of the Qt UI Elements. You may encounter for example: a Button with really small text, TextLabel with incomplete text and so on.

Sorry about that :(

I shall be uploading another version of the MySQL Frontend for Windows, with the necessary tweaks applied, sometime in the future.
