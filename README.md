# MySQL-Frontend for Windows 10
A stripped-down GUI frontend developed in Python3 for simple admin tasks on MySQL-Server running on the localhost. Developed for my CS School Project.

# What's different
This branch now has its GUI optimised for windows using the fonts provided by MS.
Other than that, there's hardly any difference.

# System Requirements:
This program should run on your Windows computer with Python3, MySQL Server, and the below-mentioned Python Libraries installed.

# Installation Pre-requisites
1. The Following Python Libraries are required to execute the program:
    1. pyqt5

You may use the PIP package manager to install the above modules on your system Python3 environment or
using the adjacent library package manager bundled in with your IDE.

2. MySQL/MariaDB-Server from v5.1 and above, active and running.
